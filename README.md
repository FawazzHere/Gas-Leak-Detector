🧪 Gas Leak Detector with Arduino
A simple Arduino-based system that detects harmful gases in the air (like LPG, smoke, or CO₂) using a gas sensor. When a leak is detected, the system alerts with a buzzer and LED.

⚙️ How It Works
The gas sensor continuously monitors air quality.

If gas levels exceed a safe threshold:

The buzzer sounds

The LED lights up

Sensor readings are shown on the Serial Monitor.

🧩 Components Used
Arduino Uno

MQ-2 or MQ-135 Gas Sensor

Buzzer

LED + Resistor

Jumper Wires

Breadboard

📈 Output
Real-time gas value readings on the Serial Monitor

Automatic alert when gas is detected
