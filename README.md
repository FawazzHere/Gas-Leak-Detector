# Gas-Leak-Detector
A simple Arduino-based project that uses the MQ-2/MQ-135 gas sensor to detect harmful gases like LPG or smoke. When the gas level crosses a threshold, a buzzer sounds and an LED lights up, alerting the user to a potential gas leak.
⚠️ Safety Tip
This sensor is not suitable for real-life gas leak protection—only for educational/demo use.
